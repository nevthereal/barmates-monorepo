## New font

I, [Neville Brem](https://github.com/nevthereal), the head of design, have been thinking about our design decisions. For a long time, we had the "boring" _Montserrat_ font as our branding font, which I didn't find very pleasing and playful, so I went out and looked for another one. Now, we have this playful font called _Grandstander_.

I myself really like this font since it looks playful, is readable and looks a bit more interesting than
_Montserrat_ because it is a bit more twirky and looks handwritten.

Regarding color scheme, I don't really see us rewriting it, since I pretty much like the colors, but if you have recommendations or are a colorist (does that exist?) yourself, feel free to contact us on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/barmates_official).

## Store

Otherwise I have been actively working on our web store, the progress, if you're a developer and interested, you can see [here](https://github.com/nevthereal/barmates-monorepo/tree/main/shop).

That's it for this one. Have a nice one, don't stop grinding and stay fit!
