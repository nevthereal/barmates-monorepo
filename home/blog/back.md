# Guess who's back, back again

First of all, we apologize to be gone for so long. We didn't really have the time to work on stuff lately, so we had to pause **BarMates** for a while.

## New Staff!

Anyways, we are now back again. With a new co-founder, [Eljas Puhakka](https://linkedin.com/in/eljas-puhakka-a07672227) we are ready to continue the business.

## New website!

Regarding other stuff, I, [Neville Brem](https://github.com/nevthereal), have been reworking the page. We now got this fancy blog, and on top of that, I am busy designing the catalogue page.s

## New stuff?

We are hardly working on our products and are excited to launch them for you soon, expectedly within this year.

'Til then, have a nice one!
